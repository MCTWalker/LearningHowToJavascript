# Welcome to Learning How To Javascript!

## What is this Repository

This is a place for people to learn and teach how to write Javascript. It is opensource and free! Feel free to contribute lessons if you would like.

What it's not: A place to teach/learn about frameworks (eww).

### Start Learning

All you need to start learning how to program javascript is a text editor and browser. You can download these files using git if you're that advanced or you can just copy them to your computer, either by copy pasting the text or downloading the zip file using github's download button.

2. Lesson instructions can be in text/elements you can view in the browser or in comments in the html file or a combination of both.
